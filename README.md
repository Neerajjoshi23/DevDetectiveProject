The project is simple. In this UI on entering the valid github id will generate the details about the account corresponding to it.
In project I had used basic API fetch call for bringing the data from the server to our (client) side and then converting it to json format for  rendering on UI and also use the
basic concept of  await and sync function  during API call and conversion.
UI also have feature of Dark and light mode on clicking the Button which has event listener for responding to the request.
